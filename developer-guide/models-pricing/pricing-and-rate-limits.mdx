## API Pricing

The Fish Audio API uses pay-as-you-go pricing based on actual usage. There are no subscription fees or monthly minimums for API access.

<Note>
    For most recent pricing information, please visit our [pricing page](https://fish.audio/app/billing).
</Note>

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models

TTS pricing is based on the size of input text, measured in millions of UTF-8 bytes.

| Model Name   | Price (USD)            |
|--------------|------------------------|
| `speech-1.5` | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |
| `speech-1.6` | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |
| `s1`         | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |

<Info>
1M UTF-8 bytes is approximately 180,000 English words, or about 12 hours of speech
</Info>

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Models

| Model Name     | Price (USD)        |
|----------------|--------------------|
| `transcribe-1` | $0.36 / audio hour |

**How ASR billing works:**
- Charges are based on the duration of audio processed
- Duration is rounded up to the nearest second

## Rate Limits

These limits help us ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users.

### Concurrent Request Limits

| Tier       | Spending Threshold | Concurrent Requests |
