## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

## Instant Voice Cloning

Clone a voice on-the-fly without creating a persistent model using [`ReferenceAudio`](/api-reference/sdk/python/types#referenceaudio-objects):

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={6-15}
from fishaudio import FishAudio
from fishaudio.types import ReferenceAudio
from fishaudio.utils import play

client = FishAudio()

# Clone from reference audio
with open("reference_voice.wav", "rb") as f:
    audio = client.tts.convert(
        text="This will sound like the reference voice",
        references=[ReferenceAudio(
            audio=f.read(),
            text="Text spoken in the reference audio"
        )]
    )
play(audio)
```

```python Asynchronous focus={8-17}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio
from fishaudio.types import ReferenceAudio
from fishaudio.utils import play

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Clone from reference audio
    with open("reference_voice.wav", "rb") as f:
        audio = await client.tts.convert(
            text="This will sound like the reference voice",
            references=[ReferenceAudio(
                audio=f.read(),
                text="Text spoken in the reference audio"
            )]
        )
    play(audio)

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Instant voice cloning is perfect for one-time use cases. For repeated use of the same voice, create a persistent voice model instead.
</Note>

## Multiple Reference Samples

Improve voice quality by providing multiple reference samples:

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={6-21}
from fishaudio import FishAudio
from fishaudio.types import ReferenceAudio
from fishaudio.utils import play

client = FishAudio()

# Load multiple reference samples
references = []
samples = [
    ("sample1.wav", "First sample transcript"),
    ("sample2.wav", "Second sample transcript"),
    ("sample3.wav", "Third sample transcript")
]

for audio_file, transcript in samples:
    with open(audio_file, "rb") as f:
        references.append(ReferenceAudio(
            audio=f.read(),
            text=transcript
        ))

# Generate with multiple references
audio = client.tts.convert(
    text="This voice is trained on multiple samples",
    references=references
)
play(audio)
```

```python Asynchronous focus={8-23}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio
from fishaudio.types import ReferenceAudio
from fishaudio.utils import play

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Load multiple reference samples
    references = []
    samples = [
        ("sample1.wav", "First sample transcript"),
        ("sample2.wav", "Second sample transcript"),
        ("sample3.wav", "Third sample transcript")
    ]

    for audio_file, transcript in samples:
        with open(audio_file, "rb") as f:
            references.append(ReferenceAudio(
                audio=f.read(),
                text=transcript
            ))

    # Generate with multiple references
    audio = await client.tts.convert(
        text="This voice is trained on multiple samples",
        references=references
    )
    play(audio)

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

## Creating Persistent Voice Models

Create a reusable voice model for consistent voice characteristics using [`voices.create()`](/api-reference/sdk/python/resources#create):

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-20}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Prepare voice samples
voice_samples = []
with open("voice1.wav", "rb") as f1:
    voice_samples.append(f1.read())
with open("voice2.wav", "rb") as f2:
    voice_samples.append(f2.read())

# Create voice model
voice = client.voices.create(
    title="My Custom Voice",
    voices=voice_samples,
    description="A custom voice for my project",
    tags=["custom", "english"],
    visibility="private"
)

print(f"Created voice: {voice.id}")
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-22}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Prepare voice samples
    voice_samples = []
    with open("voice1.wav", "rb") as f1:
        voice_samples.append(f1.read())
    with open("voice2.wav", "rb") as f2:
        voice_samples.append(f2.read())

    # Create voice model
    voice = await client.voices.create(
        title="My Custom Voice",
        voices=voice_samples,
        description="A custom voice for my project",
        tags=["custom", "english"],
        visibility="private"
    )

    print(f"Created voice: {voice.id}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### With Transcripts

Providing transcripts is faster and more accurate than automatic transcription. When you provide transcripts, the system skips running ASR (speech recognition), resulting in better performance and quality:

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-27}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Voice samples with transcripts
samples = [
    ("voice1.wav", "This is the first sample"),
    ("voice2.wav", "This is the second sample"),
    ("voice3.wav", "This is the third sample")
]

voices = []
texts = []

for audio_file, transcript in samples:
    with open(audio_file, "rb") as f:
        voices.append(f.read())
    texts.append(transcript)

# Create voice with transcripts
voice = client.voices.create(
    title="High Quality Voice",
    voices=voices,
    texts=texts,
    description="Voice with accurate transcripts",
    enhance_audio_quality=True
)

print(f"Created voice: {voice.id}")
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-29}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Voice samples with transcripts
    samples = [
        ("voice1.wav", "This is the first sample"),
        ("voice2.wav", "This is the second sample"),
        ("voice3.wav", "This is the third sample")
    ]

    voices = []
    texts = []

    for audio_file, transcript in samples:
        with open(audio_file, "rb") as f:
            voices.append(f.read())
        texts.append(transcript)

    # Create voice with transcripts
    voice = await client.voices.create(
        title="High Quality Voice",
        voices=voices,
        texts=texts,
        description="Voice with accurate transcripts",
        enhance_audio_quality=True
    )

    print(f"Created voice: {voice.id}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Audio Quality Enhancement

Enable automatic audio enhancement to clean up noisy reference audio:

```python
voice = client.voices.create(
    title="Enhanced Voice",
    voices=voice_samples,
    enhance_audio_quality=True  # Clean up background noise and normalize levels
)
```

<Note>
Audio enhancement helps process noisy or lower-quality reference audio. If your audio is already clean and well-recorded, this may not provide additional benefit.
</Note>

## Managing Voice Models

### List Voices

Discover available voices with filtering using [`voices.list()`](/api-reference/sdk/python/resources#list):

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-11}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# List all voices
voices = client.voices.list(page_size=20)
print(f"Total voices: {voices.total}")

for voice in voices.items:
    print(f"{voice.title}: {voice.id}")
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-13}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # List all voices
    voices = await client.voices.list(page_size=20)
    print(f"Total voices: {voices.total}")

    for voice in voices.items:
        print(f"{voice.title}: {voice.id}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter by Tags and Language

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-21}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Filter by tags
male_voices = client.voices.list(
    tags=["male", "english"],
    page_size=10
)

# Filter by language
chinese_voices = client.voices.list(
    language="zh",
    page_size=10
)

# Get only your own voices
my_voices = client.voices.list(
    self_only=True,
    page_size=20
)
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-23}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Filter by tags
    male_voices = await client.voices.list(
        tags=["male", "english"],
        page_size=10
    )

    # Filter by language
    chinese_voices = await client.voices.list(
        language="zh",
        page_size=10
    )

    # Get only your own voices
    my_voices = await client.voices.list(
        self_only=True,
        page_size=20
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get Voice Details

Use [`voices.get()`](/api-reference/sdk/python/resources#get) to retrieve voice details:

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-11}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Get specific voice
voice = client.voices.get("bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d")  # Adrian

print(f"Title: {voice.title}")
print(f"Description: {voice.description}")
print(f"Tags: {voice.tags}")
print(f"Languages: {voice.languages}")
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-13}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Get specific voice
    voice = await client.voices.get("bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d")  # Adrian

    print(f"Title: {voice.title}")
    print(f"Description: {voice.description}")
    print(f"Tags: {voice.tags}")
    print(f"Languages: {voice.languages}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Update Voice Metadata

Update voice information using [`voices.update()`](/api-reference/sdk/python/resources#update):

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-11}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Update voice information
client.voices.update(
    "bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d",  # Adrian
    title="Updated Voice Name",
    description="Updated description",
    visibility="public",  # "public", "unlist", or "private"
    tags=["updated", "english", "male"]
)
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-13}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Update voice information
    await client.voices.update(
        "bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d",  # Adrian
        title="Updated Voice Name",
        description="Updated description",
        visibility="public",  # "public", "unlist", or "private"
        tags=["updated", "english", "male"]
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete Voice

Remove voice models using [`voices.delete()`](/api-reference/sdk/python/resources#delete):

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous focus={5-7}
from fishaudio import FishAudio

client = FishAudio()

# Delete a voice model
client.voices.delete("bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d")  # Adrian
print("Voice deleted successfully")
```

```python Asynchronous focus={7-9}
import asyncio
from fishaudio import AsyncFishAudio

async def main():
    client = AsyncFishAudio()

    # Delete a voice model
    await client.voices.delete("bf322df2096a46f18c579d0baa36f41d")  # Adrian
    print("Voice deleted successfully")

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Deleting a voice is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you have backups of any important voice models.
