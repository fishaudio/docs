## Overview

Control how your AI voice expresses emotions, from happy and excited to sad and contemplative. Add natural pauses, laughter, and other human-like elements to make speech more engaging.

## How to Use

Simply wrap emotion tags in parentheses before your text:

```
(happy) What a beautiful day!
(sad) I'm sorry to hear that.
(excited) This is amazing news!
```

Include tone markers or audio effects:
```
(whispering) Let me tell you something.
(laughing) Ha ha ha, wow that's so funny!
```

## Important Rules

### Placement Matters

**For all languages:**
- Emotion tags MUST go at the beginning of sentences
- Tone controls can go anywhere in the text
- Sound effects can go anywhere in the text

**Correct:**
```
(happy) What a wonderful day!
```

**Incorrect:**
```
What a (happy) wonderful day!
```

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use one emotion per sentence
- Add sounds after relevant words
- Keep tags simple and clear
- Test different combinations

**Don't:**
- Overuse tags in short text
- Mix conflicting emotions
- Create custom tags
- Forget the parentheses

## Available Emotions

See the [Emotion Reference](/api-reference/emotion-reference) for the full list of supported emotions.

(brave) I'll defeat the dragon!
(struggling)(panting) This is... harder than... I thought!

## Advanced Techniques

### Emotion Transitions

Gradually change emotions:

```
(happy) I got the promotion!
(uncertain) But... it means moving away.
(sad) I'll miss everyone here.
```

### Background Effects

Add atmosphere:

```
The comedy show was amazing (audience laughing)
Everyone was having fun (background laughter)
The crowd loved it (crowd laughing)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emotion Not Working?

1. Check tag placement (beginning of sentence for emotions)
2. Verify spelling exactly matches the list
3. Don't use quotes around tags
4. Include parentheses

### Unnatural Sound?

- Add appropriate text after sound tags
- Don't overuse in short sentences
- Space out emotional changes
- Test with different voices

### Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Use basic emotions first
2. **Preview often** - Test how it sounds
3. **Be consistent** - Keep character emotions logical
4. **Less is more** - Don't overuse tags

## Get Creative

Experiment with combinations to create unique character voices and engaging narratives. The key is finding the right balance between emotional expression and natural speech flow.
