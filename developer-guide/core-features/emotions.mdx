## Overview

Fish Audio models support 64+ emotional expressions and voice styles that can be controlled through text markers in your input. Add natural pauses, laughter, and other human-like elements to make speech more engaging and realistic.

## How It Works

Simply wrap emotion tags in parentheses within your text:

```
(happy) What a beautiful day!
(sad) I'm sorry to hear that.
(excited) This is amazing news!
```

The TTS models will automatically recognize these markers and adjust the voice accordingly.

## Usage Guidelines

### Placement Rules

**For English and Most Languages:**
- Emotion tags MUST go at the beginning of sentences
- Tone controls can go anywhere in the text
- Sound effects can go anywhere in the text

**Correct:**
```
(happy) What a wonderful day!
```

**Incorrect:**
```
What a (happy) wonderful day!
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Effects

You can layer multiple emotions for complex expressions:

```
(sad)(whispering) I miss you so much.
(angry)(shouting) Get out of here now!
(excited)(laughing) We won! Ha ha!
```

### Emotion Transitions

Create natural emotional progressions:

```
(happy) I got the promotion!
(uncertain) But... it means relocating.
(sad) I'll miss everyone here.
(hopeful) Though it's a great opportunity.
(determined) I'm going to make it work!
```

### Background Effects

Add atmospheric sounds:

```
The comedy show was amazing (audience laughing)
Everyone was having fun (background laughter)
The crowd loved it (crowd laughing)
```

### Intensity Modifiers

Fine-tune emotional intensity with descriptive modifiers:

```
(slightly sad) I'm a bit disappointed.
(very excited) This is absolutely amazing!
(extremely angry) This is unacceptable!
```

## Language Support

All 13 supported languages can use emotion markers. Emotions must be at sentence start for these languages:

- **English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Dutch, Italian, Polish, Portuguese**

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Use one primary emotion per sentence
- Test different emotion combinations
- Match emotions to context logically
- Add appropriate text after sound effects (e.g., "Ha ha" after laughing)
- Use natural expressions when possible
- Space out emotional changes for realism

### Don'ts
- Don't overuse emotion tags in short text
- Don't mix conflicting emotions
- Don't create custom tags - use only supported ones
- Don't forget parentheses
- Don't place emotion tags mid-sentence in English

## Common Use Cases

### Customer Service
```
(friendly) Hello! How can I help you today?
(empathetic) I understand your frustration.
(confident) I'll resolve this for you right away.
