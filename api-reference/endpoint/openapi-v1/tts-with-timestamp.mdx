<Note>
This endpoint generates complete audio first, then aligns it with the input text to provide precise timing information for each segment. The response includes both the audio and an array of timestamp segments.
</Note>

## Response Format

The response is a JSON object containing:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `audio_base64` | string | Base64-encoded audio data |
| `text` | string | The synthesized text (with emotion markers removed) |
| `alignment` | array | Array of timestamp segments |

Each timestamp segment contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `text` | string | The text content of this segment |
| `start` | number | Start time in seconds |
| `end` | number | End time in seconds |
