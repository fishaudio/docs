## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

## Overview

Voice cloning allows you to generate speech that matches a specific voice using reference audio. Fish Audio supports two approaches:
- Using pre-trained voice models (reference_id)
- Providing reference audio directly in your request

<Tip>
Use `reference_id` when you'll reuse a voice multiple times - it's faster and more efficient. Use `references` for one-off voice cloning or testing different voices without creating models.
</Tip>

## Using Reference Audio

Clone a voice by providing reference audio directly:

```typescript
import { FishAudioClient } from "fish-audio";
import type { TTSRequest, ReferenceAudio } from "fish-audio";
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const fishAudio = new FishAudioClient();

const audioBuffer = await readFile("voice_sample.wav");
const referenceFile = new File([audioBuffer], "voice_sample.wav");

const referenceAudio: ReferenceAudio = {
  audio: referenceFile,
  text: "Text spoken in the reference audio"
};

const request: TTSRequest = {
  text: "Hello, world!",
  references: [referenceAudio]
};

const audio = await client.textToSpeech.convert(request);
```

## Multiple References

Improve voice quality by providing multiple reference samples:

```typescript
import type { TTSRequest, ReferenceAudio } from "fish-audio";
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const references = [] as ReferenceAudio[];

for (const i of [0, 1, 2]) {
  const buf = await readFile(`sample_${i}.wav`);
  references.push({ audio: new File([buf], `sample_${i}.wav`), text: `Text from sample ${i}` });
}

const request: TTSRequest = {
  text: "Better voice quality with multiple references",
  references,
};
```

## Creating Voice Models

For repeated use, create a persistent voice model:

```typescript
import { FishAudioClient } from "fish-audio";
import { createReadStream } from "fs";

const fishAudio = new FishAudioClient();

// Create a voice model from samples
const response = await fishAudio.voices.ivc.create({
  title: "My Custom Voice",
  voices: [
    createReadStream("voice_0.wav"),
    createReadStream("voice_1.wav"),
    createReadStream("voice_2.wav"),
  ],
  cover_image: createReadStream("cover.png"),
});

console.log("Created model:", response._id);

// Use the model
const audio = await fishAudio.textToSpeech.convert({
  text: "Using my saved voice model",
  reference_id: response._id,
});
```

## Best Practices

### Audio Quality

For best results, reference audio should:
- Be 10-30 seconds long per sample
- Have clear speech without background noise
- Match the language you'll generate
- Include varied intonation and emotion

### Sample Text

The text parameter in ReferenceAudio should:
- Match exactly what's spoken in the audio
- Include punctuation for proper prosody
- Be in the same language as generation

### Performance Tips

1. **Pre-upload models** for frequently used voices
2. **Use 2-3 reference samples** for optimal quality
3. **Keep samples under 30 seconds** each
4. **Normalize audio levels** before uploading

## Audio Format Requirements

Supported formats for reference audio:
- WAV (recommended)
- MP3
- M4A
- Other common audio formats

Sample rates:
- 16kHz minimum
- 44.1kHz recommended
- Mono or stereo (converted to mono)

## Example: Voice Bank

Build a library of cloned voices:

```typescript
import { FishAudioClient } from "fish-audio";

const fishAudio = new FishAudioClient();

async function createVoiceBank() {
  const voiceBank: Record<string, string> = {};
  const models = await fishAudio.voices.search();
  for (const m of models.items ?? []) voiceBank[m.title] = m._id as string;
  return voiceBank;
}

async function generateWithVoice(text: string, voiceName: string) {
  const bank = await createVoiceBank();
  const modelId = bank[voiceName];
  if (!modelId) throw new Error(`Voice '${voiceName}' not found`);
  return fishAudio.textToSpeech.convert({ text, reference_id: modelId });
}
```

## Combining with Emotions

Add emotions to cloned voices:

```typescript
// With a saved model
await fishAudio.textToSpeech.convert({
  text: "(happy) This is exciting news! (calm) Let me explain the details.",
  reference_id: "your_model_id",
});

// Or with direct references
await fishAudio.textToSpeech.convert({
  text: "(excited) Amazing discovery!",
  references: [referenceAudio],
});
```

## Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

```typescript
try {
  await fishAudio.textToSpeech.convert({ text: "Test speech", references: [referenceAudio] });
} catch (e: any) {
  const msg = String(e?.message || e);
  if (msg.includes("Invalid audio format")) console.error("Check audio format - use WAV or MP3");
  else if (msg.includes("Audio too short")) console.error("Reference audio should be at least 10 seconds");
  else throw e;
}
```

{/*
## Model Management

Basic model operations:

```typescript
// List/search
await fishAudio.voices.search();

// Get one
await fishAudio.voices.get("your_model_id");

// Update
await fishAudio.voices.update("your_model_id", { title: "new_title" });

// Delete
await fishAudio.voices.delete("your_model_id");
```
