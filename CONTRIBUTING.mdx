## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Fish Audio Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to our community team.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, please read the available [Documentation](https://docs.fish.audio).

It's best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/fishaudio) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in that issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you still need to ask a question:

1. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/fishaudio) in the relevant repository
2. Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
3. Provide project and platform versions (Node.js, Python, OS, etc.), depending on what seems relevant

We will take care of the issue as soon as possible.

**Legal Notice**

When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content, and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail:

- Make sure you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (e.g., incompatible environment components/versions)
- Check if there is already a bug report for your issue in the bug tracker
- Search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if others have discussed the issue
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager
  - Your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Can you reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

<Warning>
You must never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker. Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to our security team.
</Warning>

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue:

1. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/fishaudio) in the relevant repository
2. Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
3. Provide as much context as possible and describe the **reproduction steps** that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own
4. Provide the information you collected in the previous section

Once filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps
- If there are no reproduction steps, the team will ask for them and mark the issue as `needs-repro`
- If the team reproduces the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix` and left to be implemented

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Fish Audio, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure you are using the latest version
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.fish.audio) carefully to see if the functionality already exists
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/fishaudio) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested
- Consider whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue
- Provide a **step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why
- Include **screenshots or screen recordings** if applicable
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Fish Audio users
